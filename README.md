#README

1. Upload the RadarBot.ino file to your Arduino. (Modify pin variables as needed)
2. Run the Java program
3. enjoy



Modify the Arduino code as you like, however I would not modify the communication sections of the code. 
Any lines of code including "Serial.print" in RadarBot.ino is not recomended to be modified.

The java code is jank so be careful lmao
